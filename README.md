## About The Project

The purpose of the project was to implement in C++ Adjacency Matrix data structure representing small simple graphs and a set of operations performed on these graphs in such a way that it is visible in Python as a class inside the simple_graphs module.

## Technologies
* Python 3.9
* C++
* Windows OS

## Getting Started
* clone the repository  `git clone https://github.com/RozaliaSolecka/SimpleGraphs.git`  
* to build the module run in command-line `python setup.py build` 
* copy generated file under the path `SimpleGraphs\build\lib.win-amd64-3.8\simple_graphs.cp38-win_amd64.pyd` to the working directory SimpleGraphs
* to check the import run in command-line `python mymodule_test.py`
